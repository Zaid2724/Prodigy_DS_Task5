Project Title : Analyzing Traffic Accident Data
Project Description : This project aims to analyze a comprehensive countrywide car accident dataset covering 49 states of the USA. The dataset spans from February 2016 to March 2023 and comprises approximately 7.7 million accident records. These records were collected from various sources, including APIs provided by transportation departments, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and sensors within road networks. By leveraging advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, we seek to uncover patterns and trends related to road conditions, weather, time of day, and other factors contributing to traffic accidents. The insights gained from this analysis will inform strategies to enhance road safety measures and mitigate the impact of accidents on society.
